      <h2>My Thoughts on Writing</h2>

      <p>
        What is the difference between fiction and a metaphor?
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        I’ve been fascinated by this question ever since it was first posed to me by one of my creative writing professors in college. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
       That same professor urged us to question what truly happens when we read. He argued that reading places us in a kind of trance, one in which the author can speak directly to another mind, unburdened by the senses. Language, then, is not merely a vehicle for ideas, but, through lyricism, a conduit for emotion.
      </p>
       <p>
        Writing is a pictorial, symbolic representation of thought.
      </p>
      <br>
       <p>
        So is a work truly fiction if, while the events it describes may never have occurred, the emotion it conveys remains undeniably true?

        <h2>A FINAL DREAM</h2>

        <p>
          A FINAL DREAM is a short story that explores the boundaries between autofiction, dreams, and memory. It is interested in how a voice can feel deeply intimate while remaining fundamentally unreliable—how sincerity and bias can coexist on the same page.

        </p>

        <p>
         The piece emerged as an early experiment in how much narrative weight can be carried by texture and rhythm alone, and how much thought can be communicated through vivid yet seemingly unrelated imagery.

        </p>

        <p>
          The story follows the internal logic of a dream—or more precisely, a half-dream—experienced by a narrator drifting in and out of sleep. It exists in a thin space of fourth-wall ruptures and self-designed psychosis, through which the narrator speaks directly to both the audience and himself.
