        <h3>A Little Note on my Journey with Film</h3>
        <p>
          Arriving at college, my love of storytelling found a new frontier: the technicolour world of audiovisual storytelling.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I started from humble beginnings, holding a boom pole on set, and eventually directed my own short film. I had loved watching movies for as long as I could remember, but I was surprised to discover that I loved being on set even more.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Being on set taught me how intensely collaborative and demanding filmmaking is. One of my history teachers once told me that the key to Napoleon’s success was his obsession with detail: his ledgers recorded everything from rope lengths to ammunition weights. Film sets feel similar. Every small decision matters, and preparation is what allows improvisation to happen.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I learned what it means to plan obsessively, only for everything to go wrong on the day: adapting on the fly, handling expensive and fragile equipment, managing large teams of (often unpaid) people, sticking to excessively tight and ambitious schedules, and on top of all that, still trying to make something beautiful.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          As someone drawn to both complex systems and storytelling, working on student sets (logistical nightmares that they often are) proved to be a trial by fire that sharpened both instincts. While I don’t think filmmaking will be my primary career, it’s a medium I’ll always return to, both as a discipline and as a way of thinking about storytelling.

        <h2>COLOUR GRADING (2024)</h2>
        <p class="film-meta">
          Writer/Director · Short Film · 3:45
        </p>
         <p>
          COLOUR GRADING is a 4-minute short film I co-wrote, co-directed, and (regrettably) starred in.  
        </p>
        <p>
          On the surface, the project is fairly conventional. As first-time directors, my co-director and I set out to make something formally disciplined and quietly respectable, with a strong deference for industry standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, the film subtly pushes against that restraint. One such way is through its black-and-white palette. While a monochrome filter over a story about a color-blind artist risks being on the nose, we approached it less as a literal representation of sight and more as an extension of Novikov’s noir-inflected, gloomy interiority (the color, notably, never returns).
        </p>

        <p>
          A similar instinct guided the sound design: non-diegetic elements used sparingly but deliberately: a remixed toilet flush to externalize inner turmoil, a nearly imperceptible sustained note to prime emotional tension. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Ultimately, what interested us most was not the return of color or sound, but the question of whether it was ever missing in the first place.
        </p>

        <p>
          For me, the film became an early experiment in using formal constraint as a tool for emotional expression, an approach I continue to return to across mediums.
        </p>
